# Security Policy

## Considerations

The COBOL Programming Course does not produce any kind of software. This project produces a technical course aimed to educate people on COBOL programming. The output of this project is in the form of PDF documents detailing the course content. A Markdown version is also available on the repository.

## Supported Version

Only the [latest version](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/cobol-programming-course/releases/latest) of the course is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you are aware of any significant vulnerability, or evidence of any, please send an email to the security contacts and we'll respond as soon as possible. For now, the security contacts are Michael Bauer, Hartanto Ario Widjaya and Sudharsana Srinivasan. The security contacts' email addresses can be found on the [COMMITTERS.csv](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/cobol-programming-course/blob/master/COMMITTERS.csv) file.

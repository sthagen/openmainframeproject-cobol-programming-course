# COBOL Programming Course Q1 2022 Webinar
February 8 @ 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM PST

## Description

Since the launch of Open Mainframe Projectâ€™s COBOL Programming Course two years ago, we have held quarterly TSC calls to encourage our learners, COBOL fans and the community at large to join us to learn more about our work we drive and provide inputs and thoughts about the course.

For our 1st quarter session webinar on Tuesday, February 8 at 9 am PT/12 pm ET, we are excited to have Rune Christensen from Bankdata as our guest speaker, joining us to talk about COBOL and this specific COBOL course and how his team leverages it.

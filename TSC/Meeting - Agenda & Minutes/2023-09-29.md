# COBOL Programming Course Q3 2023 Webinar
Sep 29 @ 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM PT

## Description

If you were to take a look back, what did you do for your summer break? Well for one student it was a summer of learning COBOL, writing a new chapter about Unit Testing & Test Driven Development & integrating an open source unit test tool into the OMP COBOL Programming Course. Yes - one student did all that, in one summer!!! 

You don't want to miss this opportunity to hear firsthand from Ashis Kumar Naik, our 2023 Summer Mentee, about his summer with COBOL. His mentor Lezlie Browder, an IBM Ambassador and Chief Solutionist with decades of mainframe experience, will also share her experience and the entire team will be available to answer questions about the course, mentorship or COBOL in general.

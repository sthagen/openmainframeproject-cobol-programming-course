# COBOL Programming Course Q2 2023 Webinar
Jun 21 @ 9:30 AM - 10:15 AM PT

## Description

Since the launch of Open Mainframe Project’s COBOL Programming Course two years ago, we have held quarterly TSC calls to encourage our learners, COBOL fans and the community at large to join us to learn more about our work we drive and provide inputs and thoughts about the course.

Join us on Wednesday, June 21 at 9:30 am PT, for the COBOL Programming Course Q2 Webinar. The core COBOL team will be joined by Lezlie Browder, an Open Mainframe Project Summer Mentor with several years of COBOL experience. She recently went through the COBOL Programming Course and experimented with Zowe and COBOL Check. She’ll share her experience, feedback and more.

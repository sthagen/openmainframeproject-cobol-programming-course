Our many learners, contributors, and community members are the adopters of this project.

> I am using this material as a major part of my COBOL I course, both at East Carolina University and Tennessee State University. It is very accessible for the novice and gives a great introduction to VS Code and using GUI interfaces with COBOL for modern software delivery. <br>
> *— Cameron Seay, Ph.D., Adjunct Professor at East Carolina University and Tennessee State University*

> At Bankdata we use the COBOL Programming Course to onboard new developers that are not familiar with COBOL. It enables us to quickly get developers into coding COBOL, and is a good match for onboarding on our developer platform, which is based on VS Code. <br>
> *— Rune Christensen, Lead Software Developer at Bankdata, Denmark*
